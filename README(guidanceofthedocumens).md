There are four documents in this repository. 

The first one is the answer of the first question.

The second second is python file that includes the amazon website automation test case. The user should change the directory of the document to run it.

The third one is postman collection. This document includes the endpoints from https://reqres.in/. Parameters added from website and, responses as I expected. Hovewer, some parameters should be changed and added because of the code quality. The parameters that I want to change added the excel document.

The fourth one is excel document. It includes the manual test cases from the https://reqres.in/ endpoints. I try to identify pass and fail cases. Also, my comments added at the last column.
