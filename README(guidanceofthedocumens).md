There are four documents in this repository. 

- The first one is the answer of the first question.

- The second second is Pytest that includes the amazon website automation test case. PyTest is the testing tool that I used. There are three cases first one is the checking source. The second one is testing whether the searching items loaded successfully. The third one is the quit and close.
  The user should change the directory of the document to run it. 
  The user should go preferences ---> python integrated tools -----> default test runner should be selected pytest and pytest package should be installed. The user open test_amazon.py in terminal and execute pytest test_amazon.py
 
  

The third one is the postman collection. This document includes the endpoints from https://reqres.in/. Parameters added from website and, responses as I expected. Hovewer, some parameters should be changed and added because of the code quality. The parameters that I want to change added the excel document.

The fourth one is the excel document. It includes the manual test cases from the https://reqres.in/ endpoints. I try to identify pass and fail cases. Also, my comments added at the last column.
